        What is <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>? <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing
        and typesetting industry. <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard
        dummy text ever since the <b><i>1500s</i></b> , when an unknown printer took a galley
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
        not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged.  <p>It was popularised in the <b><i>1960s</i></b  with
        the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact
        that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
        looking at its layout.</p> <p>The point of using <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is that it has a
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
        desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> as
        their default model text, and a search for '<strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>' will uncover
        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
        over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
        humour and the like).</p>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable .</p>  <p> <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> comes from sections <u>1.10.32</u>  and <u>1.10.33 </u> of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <em>45</em>  BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
